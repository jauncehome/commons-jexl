                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:
=============

JEXL is a library intended to facilitate the implementation of dynamic and scripting features in
applications and frameworks written in Java.

JEXL implements an Expression Language based on some extensions to the JSTL Expression Language supporting most of the
constructs seen in shell-script or ECMAScript.

Its goal is to expose scripting features usable by technical operatives or consultants working with enterprise platforms.

Java 8 is required.

========================================================================================================================
Release 3.3
========================================================================================================================

Version 3.3 is a minor release.

Compatibility with previous releases
====================================
Version 3.3 is source and binary compatible with 3.2.
However, the default setting for permissions that determine which packages, classes and methods are accessible
to scripts has been reduced to a very narrow set. When migrating from previous version of JEXL, this may result
in breaking your application behavior ; this breaking change requires remediation in your code.
Despite the obvious inconvenience - our sincere apologies on the matter -, how much functional and semantic power is
accessible through scripts has a real impact on your application security and stability ; that potential risk requires
an informed review and conscious choice on your end.
To mitigate the change, you can revert to the previous behavior with one line of code  (see JexlPermissions, JexlBuilder
and JexlScriptEngine) or use this opportunity to reduce exposure. Whether Files, URLs, networking, processes,
class-loaders or reflection classes or whether loops or side effects are accessible are part of your choice to make.

What's new in 3.3:
==================
JEXL 3.3 brings the ability to configure permissions on libraries in the manner pioneered
with the @NoJexl annotation on source code. This is achieved through a crude but light mechanism akin to
a security manager that controls what JEXL can introspect and thus expose to scripts.
Used in conjunction with options (JexlOptions) and features (JexlFeatures), the permissions (JexlPermissions)
allow fine-tuning the end-user freedom and scripting integration through syntactic and semantic sanitation.
JEXL 3.3 also adds some syntactic (ECMAScript) features (let, const, =>, for, ...) to further reduce
the skill set required to write scripts.

New Features in 3.3:
====================
* JEXL-392:     Enable namespace declaration based on scripts
* JEXL-391:     Improve in/=~ operator when arguments are arrays and collections
* JEXL-390:     Pragmas should not be statements
* JEXL-389:     Improve parsing timings
* JEXL-385:     Support disabling fortran-style relational operators syntax
* JEXL-382:     Simplify grammar and lexical state management
* JEXL-380:     Multiple values per pragma key
* JEXL-379:     Allow new to use class identifier
* JEXL-373:     Add support for prefix/postfix increment/decrement operators
* JEXL-372:     Add support for 'standard' for loop
* JEXL-369:     Add 'let' and 'const' variable declarations
* JEXL-367:     Named function and fat-arrow (=>) lambda syntax
* JEXL-366:     Fail to evaluate string and number comparison
* JEXL-365:     Lambda expressions
* JEXL-363:     Allow retrieving captured variables in script
* JEXL-360:     Add missing bitshift operators ( >>, >>>, <<)
* JEXL-359:     Allow per-operator arithmetic handling of null arguments
* JEXL-357:     Configure accessible packages/classes/methods/fields

Bugs Fixed in 3.3:
==================
* JEXL-386:     Non-inheritable permissions on interfaces are ignored in an inheritable sandbox
* JEXL-384:     Improve control over JexlArithmetic null argument handling
* JEXL-378:     Incremental operator and decremental operator do not honor the side-effect flag
* JEXL-376:     Introspector captures methods on non-exported classes (modules, java9+)
* JEXL-375:     Cannot access enums by their name when using sandbox
* JEXL-374:     No exception if dereferencing null object using safe(false) and antish(false)
* JEXL-371:     Override of a protected method with public visibility is not callable
* JEXL-370:     Cannot check if variable is defined using ObjectContext if the value is null
* JEXL-368:     Namespace functor resolution is not cached
* JEXL-364:     Evaluator options not propagated in closures
* JEXL-362:     JexlInfo position reporting is off
* JEXL-361:     Null may be used as operand silently even in arithmetic strict(true) mode
* JEXL-354:     #pragma does not handle negative integer or real literals
* JEXL-353:     Documentation error for not-in/not-match operator

========================================================================================================================
Release 3.2.1
========================================================================================================================

Version 3.2.1 is a maintenance release.

Compatibility with previous releases
====================================
Version 3.2.1 is source and binary compatible with 3.2.

Bugs Fixed in 3.2.1:
==================
* JEXL-352:      Possible memory leak regarding parser jjtree nodes in JEXL 3.2
* JEXL-351:      JXLT Template fails when using sandboxing
* JEXL-350:      map[null] throws "unsolvable property" when a Sandbox is used

========================================================================================================================
Release 3.2
========================================================================================================================

Version 3.2 is a minor release.

Compatibility with previous releases
====================================
Version 3.2 is binary compatible with 3.1. However, JEXL now requires Java 8 or above.

Unfortunately, it is not strictly source compatible. This release does break source compatibility by adding methods to existing
interfaces and an abstract method to an abstract class. However, since these interfaces and class are not expected to be implemented
or derived by code external to the JEXL project, this compatibility break should remain unnoticeable.
It is nevertheless possible and we are sorry if it causes problems to any of you.

What's new in 3.2:
==================
* Lexical scoping for local variables and parameters allowing at parse and/or runtime to reduce scripting errors and bugs and align with
  known development languages best practice (C, Java, ...).
* Interpolated strings in identifiers, as in x.`${prefix}_${suffix}` that in many cases would be equivalent to
  x[prefix + '_' + suffix] or x[`${prefix}_${suffix}`].
* Safe-navigation mode and operator '?.' allowing lenient handling of non-existent or null properties so that an expression
  like 'x?.y?.z' would behave as 'x.y.z' in nominal execution and return null instead of throwing an exception in error
  cases. The safe() option on the builder enables the behavior making '.' and '[...]' behave as '?.'.
* A set of syntactic restrictions can be applied to scripts ranging from not allowing side-effects to not allowing
  loops enabling fine control over what end-users may be able to enter as expressions/scripts.

New Features in 3.2:
====================
* JEXL-344:      Don't fill stack trace for JexlExpression#Return (to improve performance)
* JEXL-334:      Remove offensive terminology from code and API
* JEXL-333:      Allow declaration of namespace within script

========================================================================================================================
Release 3.1
========================================================================================================================

Version 3.1 is a minor release.

Compatibility with previous releases
====================================
Version 3.1 is binary compatible with 3.0.

However it is not source compatible, this release does break source compatibility by adding methods to existing
interfaces; these interfaces are however not expected to be implemented by code external to the JEXL project.
This compatibility break should remain hypothetical. It is nevertheless possible and we are sorry if it causes problems
to any of you.
If you encounter this issue, besides continuing using JEXL 3.0, your code likely delegates method calls to JEXL3 objects
and you shall be able to continue doing so with these new methods.

The three interfaces and methods are:

1 - 'isCancellable()' in interface org.apache.commons.jexl3.JexlEngine$Options
2 - 'callable(JexlContext)' in interface org.apache.commons.jexl3.JexlExpression
3 - 'getPragmas()' in interface org.apache.commons.jexl3.JxltEngine$Template

What's new in 3.1:
==================
* Annotations syntax (@annotation) and processing capabilities.
  Annotations in JEXL are 'meta-statements'; they allow to wrap the execution of the JEXL statement in a user provided
  caller; a typical example would be: ""@synchronized(x) x.someMethod();". Annotations may be declared with zero or more
  parameters. Annotation processing is implemented by providing a JexlContext.AnnotationProcessor; its processAnnotation
  method will call the annotated statement encapsulated in a Callable. Annotation arguments are evaluated and passed
  as arguments to processAnnotation.
* Better support for script execution options, error handling and cancelling.
* All operators can be overloaded.

New Features in 3.1:
====================
* JEXL-222:     The ability to declare indexed property getter/setter in customized JexlArithmetic implementation
* JEXL-219:     Blacklist by default in sandbox
* JEXL-216:     Improve parsing concurrency in multithreaded environment
* JEXL-211:     Add callable method to JexlExpression interface
* JEXL-201:     Allow Interpreter to use live values from JexlEngine.Option interface implemented by JexlContext
* JEXL-198:     JxltEngine Template does not expose pragmas
* JEXL-197:     Add annotations
* JEXL-194:     Allow synchronization on iterableValue in foreach statement

Bugs Fixed in 3.1:
==================
* JEXL-221:     Sporadic undefined property error caused by NPE at MapGetExecutor.tryInvoke()
* JEXL-217:     Interpreter.getAttribute() raises exception in non-strict mode when cached property resolver is used
* JEXL-215:     JexlEngine.createInfo() is redundantly called when debug and caching is enabled leading to sub-optimal performance
* JEXL-214:     Redundant call of fillInStackTrace() in JexlEngine.createInfo() ?

========================================================================================================================
Release 3.0
========================================================================================================================

Version 3.0 is a major release changing the public JEXL API.

Due to binary and source incompatibilities and the scope of modifications, JEXL has moved to the
org.apache.commons.jexl3 package.
However, this is a drop-in replacement through JSR-223 and casual code usage should find easy equivalence between
jexl-2.x and 3.x (besides the package name).
Also note that JEXL 3.0 now requires Java 6.


What's new in 3.0:
==================
* A redesigned API that properly segregates the "public" part and the "internal" parts of JEXL.
* A real difference between Expression and Script (scripts accept statements: for, while, etc).
* The ability to create JEXL functions in script, closure/variables hoisting/currying included.
* A set of assignment operators (+=, *= , ...).
* A set of String matching operators (^= startsWith, $= endsWith) and their negative counterparts (!^, !$)
* A range operator (x .. y) to ease writing loops (for(var x : 1 .. 10) ... )
* A literal set syntax to ease creating sets: { 1, 2...}

New features in 3.0:
====================
* JEXL-178:     'Unsolvable property' message to provide details about underlying exception
* JEXL-177:     Unified expressions to be used in String literals in JEXL scripts

* JEXL-135:     Using map as script parameter or local variable
* JEXL-134:     Issue with evaluation of concat of variables : \r + \n gives 0
* JEXL-131:     UnifiedJexl parsing may fail with NPE
* JEXL-130:     Ternary Conditional fails for Object values
* JEXL-126:     Decimal numbers literals should be 'double' by default (instead of 'float')

========================================================================================================================
Release 2.1.1
========================================================================================================================

Version 2.1.1 is a micro release to fix a regression detected in 2.1:

* JEXL-124:     Array parameters to methods don't work anymore (JEXL 2.1.1)

There are no other changes.


========================================================================================================================
Release 2.1
========================================================================================================================

Version 2.1 is a minor release adding new features and fixing known issues detected in 2.0.

Compatibility with previous releases
====================================
Version 2.1 is binary compatible with 2.0.1.

However it is not source compatible.
New methods have been added to the org.apache.commons.jexl2.Script and org.apache.commons.jexl2.JexlInfo interfaces.
Any source code that implements these interfaces will need to be updated.

What's new in 2.1:
==================
* A more thorough arithmetic (JexlArithmetic) that allows fine control over decimals (scale and precision), a
  new syntax for numeric literals (OGNL inspired Big and Huge notations) and a better type handling keeping the most
  appropriate representation in casual operations.
* The introduction of script variables and parameters that reduce context dependencies and methods; this allows to
  perform checks after script creation (light static checking hints). Plus the ability to call script from scripts.
* A sandoxing feature to restrict and rename what JEXL can access from the environment allowing tighter control over security.
* Extensions to UnifiedJEXL that allow the creation of templates.

New features in 2.1:
====================
* JEXL-114:     Allow scripts to create local variables // Add return keyword
* JEXL-113:     Add functions to extract which variables, parameters and local variables are used to evaluate a script
* JEXL-118:     Provide an IN operator

* JEXL-119:     Allow indexed properties container resolution in expressions
* JEXL-106:     When divide two BigDecimal values in an expression it results in java.lang.ArithmeticException
* JEXL-102:     Add "jexl2" as a supported name

Bugs Fixed in 2.1:
==================
* JEXL-83:      Make JexlArithmetic immutable (and threadsafe)
* JEXL-24:      Support Long for integer literal instead of Integers
* JEXL-107:     literals and parenthesized expressions can not be used as references
* JEXL-108:     parsing error if i define a empty literal array/map
* JEXL-101:     Vararg methods where the first argument is no vararg can not be called with only the fixed parameters given
* JEXL-105:     Array literals are considered constant even when they are not
* JEXL-104:     NPE in JexlArithmetic when an Array-Expression containing a null is used.
* JEXL-112:     Cannot parse Integer.MIN_VALUE
* JEXL-111:     expression execute error

Bugs fixed in 2.0.1:
====================

Other Changes:
==============

o Add @since 2.0 tags to code so we can track API additions via Javadoc

Upgrading from JEXL 1.x
=======================

JEXL now requires Java 1.5 or later.

Version 2.0 resides in the org.apache.commons.jexl2 package; part of the version 1.x API is reimplemented as an
add-on source library in the jexl-compat directory; since it can not fully reimplement the original public 1.x, it may
only be used to ease transition in strictly controlled deployments.

The following classes are implemented through the jexl-compat source library:
  * ExpressionFactory
  * ScriptFactory
  * Expression
  * Script
  * JexlContext
  * JexlHelper

Migration notes
===============

When migrating from jexl 1.x to jexl 2.0, the following hints may be helpfull.

The following classes no longer exist:
  * ExpressionFactory, ScriptFactory: create a JexlEngine and use createExpression() or createScript()
  instead.

The following classes have been renamed and replaced:

  * VelMethod <=> JexlMethod
  * VelPropertyGet <=> JexlPropertyGet
  * VelPropertySet <=> JexlPropertySet

The following methods have been removed:

  * Info.getTemplateName() - use Info.getName() instead
  * Expression.addPostResolver() / Expression.addPreResolver() - set ant-like variables in JexlContext, implement
    a specific JexlContext or derive JexlcontextInterpreter/JexlEngine instead

Behavior changes
================

* Public fields are considered when using JexlPropertyGet / JexlPropertySet: JEXL 1.x behavior can be reimplemented
by subclassing UberspectImpl.

*Division (/ operator) behavior change: division between integers no longer casts its operands to double; integer division
    allways results in a integer. The 1.x behavior can be reimplemented by subclassing JexlArithmetic.

New Features:
=============

Assignment expression: a = b (and a.b.c = d)
   * Assigns a variable (ant-like variable or bean-property)

Ternary operator expression: a ? b : c  (and a ?: c)
   * The usual inline conditional shortcut and its 'Elvis' form (a ?: b evaluates as a ? a : b)

Constructor call expression: new('my.class.name', arguments...)
   * Creates a new instance of a class using the most appropriate constructor according
     to the actual arguments

Function namespace: ns:func(arguments...)
   * A function namespace allows the use of class or instance methods in function calls

UnifiedJEXL
   * Adds ${...} and #{...} JSP/EL syntax support on top of the JexlEngine

JSR-223 support
   * Implement JSR-223 Scripting Engine for JEXL script (need BSF-3.0 on Java < 6)

Error and exception handling
   * Configuring the leniency and verbosity of the JEXL engine allows user control over the
     error handling policy
